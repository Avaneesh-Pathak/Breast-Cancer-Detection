**Breast Cancer Prediction Project**

**Overview:**
This project aims to build a breast cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model will take various features related to breast cancer patients and provide a prediction whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The dataset used for training and testing the model will be provided separately.

**Dataset:**
The dataset contains various attributes of breast cancer patients, such as age, tumor size, tumor type, hormone receptor status, histological grade, and more. It is divided into two main parts: features (input data) and labels (output data). The features represent the attributes of patients, while the labels indicate whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

**Requirements:**
- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook or any other code editor to run the Python script
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check the version by running the command `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

**Project Structure:**
- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset files. The dataset should be split into two separate CSV files: one for features (e.g., `cleaned_data.csv`) and one for labels (e.g., `labels.csv`).
- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `README.md`: The README file you are currently reading.

**Data Preparation:**
1. Place the feature and label CSV files in the `data/` folder.
2. Update the file paths in the Jupyter Notebook to correctly load the data.

**Running the Notebook:**
1. Open the `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any other code editor that supports Python.
2. Execute the cells one by one to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.
3. The trained model's accuracy and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the notebook.

**Model Selection:**
In this project, we will use a supervised machine learning model, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines. The choice of the model can be experimented with to find the best-performing one.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
To assess the model's performance, we will use common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

**Results and Interpretation:**
The final output will be a prediction for each sample in the dataset, indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign. We will also visualize the model's performance using various plots and graphs.

**Conclusion:**
The breast cancer prediction model aims to assist medical professionals in identifying potential cancer cases, allowing for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes. It is essential to interpret the model's results cautiously and seek advice from healthcare professionals before making any clinical decisions.

**Note:**
Please keep in mind that this is a research-oriented model and should not replace medical diagnosis by a qualified healthcare professional. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of machine learning for breast cancer prediction, and the model's predictions should be cross-validated with real medical tests for any practical application.
